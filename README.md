# Learn2Code
A free online open source initiative with the purpose of making algorithmic programming knowledge easier for everyone to learn. Programming algorithms is an essential skill important for anyone interested in Computer Science, but it can be difficult to learn, especially for people who are new to the field. I started this initiative in order to help beginners comfortably learn about writing algorithms without jumping into more advanced topics. Basic questions are solved and explained in C++.
